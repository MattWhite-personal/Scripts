# Scripts Repository

Welcome to the **Scripts** repository! This collection is designed to serve the wider IT community by providing a variety of useful scripts, each aimed at simplifying, automating, or enhancing common IT tasks.

## Repository Structure

- Each script is organized into its own directory within the repository.
- Every script folder contains:
  - The script itself
  - An individual `README.md` file with a detailed description and usage instructions

This modular structure enables easy navigation, understanding, and collaboration for users and contributors alike.
