# Get-EntraSCIMReport.ps1

## Overview

`Get-EntraSCIMReport.ps1` is a PowerShell script that audits all Service Principals in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) to determine which ones have SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) synchronization jobs configured. The script outputs a CSV report summarizing the SCIM provisioning status for each Service Principal.

This utility is valuable for IT administrators who need to monitor, audit, or troubleshoot SCIM provisioning across enterprise applications in Entra ID.

## Features

## Prerequisites

- PowerShell 7.x or later (recommended).
- Microsoft Graph PowerShell modules installed:
  ```powershell

   ```

2. **Run the script with required parameters:**

   ```powershell
   .\Get-EntraSCIMReport.ps1 -exportPath "C:\Reports\SCIMReport.csv"
   ```

   This outputs only Service Principals with SCIM jobs.

   To include all Service Principals (including those without SCIM jobs):

   ```powershell
   .\Get-EntraSCIMReport.ps1 -exportPath "C:\Reports\SCIMReport.csv" -reportAll $true
   ```

3. **Parameters:**
   - `-exportPath` (required): Path to save the CSV report.
   - `-reportAll` (optional, default: `$false`): If `$true`, includes Service Principals without SCIM jobs.

## Example Output

The generated CSV will include:

| ServicePrincipalId                        | ServicePrincipalDisplayName | Job                  |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|
| 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000      | My SCIM App                | SCIM is configured   |
| 11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555      | Some Other App             | SCIM is not configured |

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Module errors:**  
  Ensure the Microsoft Graph PowerShell modules are installed.

- **Permission errors:**  
  Make sure your account has sufficient permissions (`Synchronization.Read.All`, `Application.Read.All`).

- **Path errors:**  
  The parent directory for your export path must exist.

- **Authentication:**  
  The script will prompt for authentication if not already connected.
